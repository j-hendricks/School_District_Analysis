# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we are tasked with analyzing standardized test data for several schools in the same school district, the goal being to find performance trends and patterns. This data will be used by the local school board to make decisions on school funding in the school district. The school board has provided us with school funding data and standardized test scores, which were separated into csv files containing ![school data](schools_complete.csv) and ![student data](students_complete.csv). The ![analysis](PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb) was performed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Two problems arose when analyzing the student data: 1) several student names contained incorrect prefixes and suffixes, such as MD or PhD. These misnomers were cleaned using basic string manipulation. 2) There were reports of cheating in the ninth grade class at Thomas High School. As a result, standardized test scores had to be removed for these students, which altered the resulting statistics for Thomas High.
